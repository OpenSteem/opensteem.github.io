Because OpenSteem is an open standard anyone can submit changes by creating a pull request on our [Github repo](https://github.com/OpenSteem/opensteem.github.io) or by clicking on the `Edit me` button on any page. If you are interested in becoming a long-term contributor contact [@thekyle](https://steemit.com/@thekyle) to have your Github account added to the project.

# Getting Started
OpenSteem.org uses this [Jekyll Documentation Theme](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/), which you may want to read the documentation for if you are unfamiliar with Jekyll. To contribute changes you may either clone our github repo using:
`git clone git@github.com:OpenSteem/opensteem.github.io.git`
or fork it using the tools available through the Github GUI. After you've made changes to the standard submit a pull request with details about what you've changed.

# Additional Notes
* If creating a new page make sure to add it to the sidebar in `_data/sidebars/opensteem_sidebar.yml`
* Make sure you've created the page with the proper metadata
* Make sure your changes don't break the search.
